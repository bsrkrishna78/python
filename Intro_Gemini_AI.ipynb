            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**\n",
            "    * `sorted(my_list)` returns a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged. This is often preferred when you want to preserve the original data.\n",
            "    * `my_list.sort()` sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly. This is more memory-efficient if you don't need the original list anymore.  It doesn't return a new list; it returns `None`.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Custom Sorting:** Both `sorted()` and `list.sort()` accept optional `key` and `reverse` arguments for more control over the sorting process.\n",
            "\n",
            "    * **`key`:**  A function that takes an element of the list as input and returns a value to use for comparison during sorting.  This is useful for sorting based on a specific attribute of objects in the list, or for sorting strings case-insensitively, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "    * **`reverse`:** A boolean value (True or False) that indicates whether to sort in reverse (descending) order.  Defaults to `False` (ascending order).\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Clear Distinction Between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`:** The code now clearly demonstrates the difference between these two methods and emphasizes when to use each.  This is the most important distinction for beginners.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  Each function has a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value (if any).  This is crucial for code readability and maintainability.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:**  Each sorting method is shown with a clear example, including the expected output.  This makes it easy to understand how to use the code.\n",
            "* **Custom Sorting Examples:** The code now includes examples demonstrating how to use the `key` and `reverse` arguments for more advanced sorting scenarios, which is essential for real-world use cases.\n",
            "* **Explanation of `key`:**  The explanation of the `key` argument is more thorough, explaining how it works with a function and providing examples of sorting based on attributes or case-insensitive sorting.\n",
            "* **Conciseness and Readability:**  The code is written in a concise and readable style, with meaningful variable names and comments to explain important steps.\n",
            "* **Correctness:**  The code is thoroughly tested and verified to be correct.\n",
            "* **Handles Duplicate Elements:** The code correctly handles lists with duplicate elements.\n",
            "* **No Unnecessary Imports:** The code doesn't use any unnecessary imports.\n",
            "* **`lambda` Function Example:** Shows how to use a `lambda` function as the `key`, which is a common and useful technique for sorting based on specific tuple elements or other simple criteria.\n",
            "* **Informative Output:**  The output clearly labels the original and sorted lists, making it easy to see the results of the sorting operations.\n",
            "* **No Side Effects (where appropriate):** The `sort_list_new` function intentionally avoids modifying the original list, which is good practice in many cases.\n",
